# Advantages of react-flip-toolkit:

<div className="big-list" />

1. **Batteries included, but highly configurable** Springs and staggers have sensible defaults but everything can be customized
2. **Multipurpose** handles enter and exit animations anywhere in the DOM tree, as well as FLIP updates
3. **Practical** Handles performance optimizations, edge cases, and the inevitable frustrating browser inconsistencies
4. **Facilitates separation of components** by allowing you to FLIP two distinct components
